Things I want to focus on soon

1. Make a form for adding results and teamstats manually
    Make this form a modal that shows when a button is clicked next
    to the results flat list

2. Make forms for updating/adjusting stats or results.

3. Figure out why the csv file upload is not reading

4. Create some sort of data visualization probably for the 
   most recent 3 matches or so.
